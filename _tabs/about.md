I am Yves Janssen Verlaak, a third-year Physics student at the University of Hasselt, driven by curiosity and a fascination with the fundamental workings of our universe. Beyond my academic interest in experimental and theoretical physics and space science, I enjoy hobbies that let me explore the skies, including sailplane gliding and launching stratospheric balloons.

My physics journey began in 2014 with Arduino-based experiments, progressing from sensor data acquisition to writing custom libraries and designing Arduino shields for more precise experimental measurements. This passion led me to join my high school's student team, the [Space Heading Deezers](https://www.dirkgeeroms.be/spaceheadingdeezers/). 

Initially, I followed the guidance of senior students, gaining hands-on experience in experimental design and data analysis, and later took on greater responsibility by mentoring new students and coordinating team initiatives alongside designing [new experiments](../tags/experiment/).

These projects included participating in the [Asgard](https://esero.be/index.php/nl/asgard-balloons-for-science/) project, launching experiments on stratospheric balloons from the RMI in Brussels to [Astro Pi](https://astro-pi.org/), an ESA program that allows students to run experiments on Raspberry Pi's aboard the International Space Station.
