I am Yves Janssen Verlaak, a third-year Bachelor’s student in Physics at the University of Hasselt, driven by curiosity and a fascination with the fundamental workings of our universe. Beyond my academic interest in experimental and theoretical physics and space science, I enjoy hobbies that let me explore the skies and nature, including sailplane gliding, skiing and launching [stratospheric balloons](../tags/stratospheric/).

My physics journey began in 2014 with Arduino-based experiments, progressing from sensor data acquisition to writing custom libraries and eventually designing Arduino shields for more precise experimental measurements. This passion led me to join my highschool's STEM team, the [Space Heading Deezers](https://www.dirkgeeroms.be/spaceheadingdeezers/). Initially, I followed the guidance of senior students, gaining hands-on experience in experimental design and data analysis. Over time, I took on greater responsibility by mentoring new students, leading team initiatives, and designing [new experiments](../tags/experiment/).

These projects included participating in [Asgard](../posts/Asgard-campaigns) projects, launching experiments on stratospheric balloons from the RMI in Brussels to [Astro Pi](https://astro-pi.org/), an ESA program that allows students to run experiments on Raspberry Pi's aboard the International Space Station. These experiences ultimately led to my contribution to the downlinking software for the [Peregrinus experiment](../posts/Peregrinus-ariane6), which was launched aboard the Ariane 6 maiden flight.

In university I continued these interests in the Oscar-QUBE group in my first year working on modelling quantum effects for NV diamond magnetometry in space and designing test equipment. In my second year organising a [stratospheric balloon program](../posts/Pi-in-the-sky/) during a course on "Experimental Techniques", launching a self-developed UV spectrometer and taking on additional experiments from highschool students.
