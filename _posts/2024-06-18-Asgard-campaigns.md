The [ASGARD](https://esero.be/index.php/nl/asgard-balloons-for-science/) project gives highschool students the opportunity to design and launch real scientific experiments to the edge of space using high-altitude balloons from the Royal Meteorological Institute in Uccle, Brussels. It is a hands-on educational program that simulates a genuine space mission, letting student teams plan, build, test, present and analyze their experiments over the course of a school year. ASGARD campaigns focus on learning, teamwork, and scientific curiosity rather than competition. 

I personally had the pleasure of partaking in this project for several years in a row, first assisting senior students, then leading the missions myself and guiding new teammates to work together to design, build and launch new experiments. Below is a list of Asgard campaigns in which I contributed and later led:

- [Asgard-X](../Asgard-X/) (2021)
- [Asgard-XI](../Asgard-XI/) (2022)
- [Asgard-XII](../Asgard-XII/) (2023)
- [Asgard-XII](../Asgard-XIII/) (2024)

Many thanks to my former high school physics teacher and dear friend **Dirk Geeroms**, whose encouragement and guidance inspired me to pursue these campaigns, as well as to all my teammates, whose collaboration and dedication made every mission possible.
